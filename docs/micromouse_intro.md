# What is Micromouse?

**Micromouse** is an internationally renowned robotics competition where small, autonomous robots (mice) must solve a maze to reach the center in the shortest possible time.

The competition tests a blend of **hardware engineering** (sensors, motors, PCB design) and **software algorithms** (mapping, pathfinding, motion control).

## 🏁 The Challenge

1.  **Exploration:** The mouse starts in a corner and must explore the unknown maze to locate the goal (usually the center).
2.  **Mapping:** As it moves, the mouse memorizes the wall configurations to build a virtual map.
3.  **Fast Run:** Once the map is known, the mouse calculates the optimal path and sprints from start to goal at high speeds (often exceeding 3-4 m/s).
